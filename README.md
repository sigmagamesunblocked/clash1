## ClashRoyale - Project
***ClashRoyale*** is a _lightweight_ Clash Royale game server.
It has been **written by Berkan** from **GameDef**.  
The goal of this emulator is to ensure a clean, easy-to-understand code environment.
ClashRoyale uses dedicated threads and async operators. 
**MongoDb servers** & a **memory based** saving server will be used to save players/clans/battles.
